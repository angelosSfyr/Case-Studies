Techonologies used that are needed to run the code:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Plotly Express

Note:
 The visualizations created using plotly express do not display properly in the notebook on Github due to the output of JavaScript because Github notebooks only display static content.
 There are html files for each case where the visualizations show properly and any interaction with them works.  Below are some examples of the visualizations.
